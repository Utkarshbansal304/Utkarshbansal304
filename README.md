# 👋 Hi, I'm Utkarsh Bansal

🎓 I'm a 4th-year B.Tech student in Computer Science Engineering at VIT Bhopal, with a deep passion for finance, investment analysis, and financial modeling. Despite my technical academic background, I’ve successfully transitioned into the world of finance through rigorous self-learning, hands-on projects, and professional simulations.

💼 My experience spans equity research, capital budgeting, 3-statement modeling, and forecasting — supported by real-world simulation internships and a growing portfolio of analytics projects.

📊 **Key Projects:**
- **Tesla 10-Year Financial Forecast (2025–2034):** Full 3-statement model with scenario analysis, published on GitHub.
- **Capital Budgeting Model for Energy Projects:** NPV, IRR, and sensitivity analysis across best/base/worst cases.
- **3-Statement Financial Model:** Scenario-based planning for a multi-segment retail business.
- **Loan Analysis for Lending Club:** End-to-end data analytics project using public Kaggle data, featuring dashboards and data storytelling.
- **Citi Investment Banking Simulation (Forage):** M&A case study, company profiling, and financial modeling as a buyside analyst.

📹 Outside of finance, I create AI-driven content for YouTube — blending spiritual storytelling, Bhagavad Gita insights, and animated humor for global audiences.
